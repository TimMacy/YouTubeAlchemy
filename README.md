Designed to be resource-efficient, it leverages YouTube's built-in elements and event listeners while using timeouts and mutation observers strategically to minimize overhead.

#### 🔒 Privacy & Security
YouTube Alchemy operates completely client-side with no external dependencies. The script doesn't send any data to remote servers or pull resources from third-party sources beyond the standard userscript metadata for update checks (@updateURL, @downloadURL) and icon display (@icon). It leverages browser’s built-in Intl APIs while storing all settings and preferences locally via GM storage or browser localStorage.

### ✨ Overview
- **Main Settings Panel**: Manage the Transcript Exporter and export, import, or reset settings to their defaults.
  - **Links in Header Panel**: Add custom links next to the YouTube logo and hide the navigation bar.
  - **Features & CSS Panel**: Access key features like **tab view**, **playback speed**, **remove 'Important' section and sort all notifications chronologically**, **video quality**, **direction buttons for playlists**, prevent autoplay, hide Shorts, **set default audio, subtitle, and transcript languages**, **disable play on hover**, **square design**, **auto-theater mode**, auto-close chat windows, number of videos per row, modify or hide various UI elements, and much more.
  - **Color Code Videos Panel**: Apply customizable borders to videos on the Home page, reflecting their age and status, and highlight the last uploaded video on the Subscriptions page with optional auto-scroll.

## 📝 Transcript Exporter
Adds buttons to the YouTube header to export a video's transcript to LLMs, with or without a prompt, or to download it as a text file.

  - **Buttons with Color-Coded Interface in the Main Settings Panel**
    - **Button One | Green** 🎧 Copies the transcript and opens NotebookLM.
    - **Button Two | Blue** 💬 Copies the transcript with a prompt for summarizing and opens ChatGPT.
    - **Button Three | Orange** Copies Transcript to Clipboard.
    - **Button Four | Red** ↓ Downloads the transcript as a text file.
    - **Button Five | White** ⋮ Opens the main settings panel.
  - **Transcript Formatting**: Includes timestamps, chapter headers, video title, channel name, upload date, and URL.
  - **Text File Naming Format**
    - Title - Channel.txt (default)
    - Channel - Title.txt
    - uploadDate - Title - Channel.txt
    - uploadDate - Channel - Title.txt

> [!TIP]
> The URLs for buttons one and two, along with all button icons, are fully customizable. If a button field is left empty, that button won’t be added to the header. The settings button reverts to its default if its field is empty. To modify the labels for NotebookLM and ChatGPT, enter "Label | domain.com" into their respective URL fields—this also updates the icons' hover text.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) in web development, JavaScript cannot directly interact across different websites: i.e. while the script can copy the transcript to the clipboard from YouTube and open a link (e.g. ChatGPT or NotebookLM), the copied transcript must be pasted manually into the text field via CTRL+V (Windows/Linux) or CMD+V (macOS).

> [!NOTE]
> Status messages for the Transcript Exporter are displayed at the button's location in the YouTube header.

## 🔗 Links in Header
Up to ten links can be added next to the YouTube logo. An empty "Link Text" field won't insert the link into the header.
If the left navigation bar is hidden, a replacement icon will prepend the links, while retaining the default functionality of opening and closing the sidebar.
